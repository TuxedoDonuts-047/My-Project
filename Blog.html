                    This morning, I woke up unwell with a bad cold. As a result, I was unable to attend College. 
                    I imformed my teacher's about this and asked a student to update me on what I missed that day. 
                    I hope that I am able to attend College tomorrow.
                    I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post and stay tuned for more updates from me.

                    <p> March 2023, I had an interesting day. 
                        I walked over to the bus station and went on it to go to Tralee to go to Munster Technological University (MTU) North Campus.</br>
                        I had a great time at the MTU North Camps open day on March 24th 2023. I was impressed by the facilities and the staff, especially in the Computing department. 
                        I attended a talk that explained what was being done on the course.
                        I also got to try out the VR suite, which was amazing.
                        It was a fun and immersive experience that made me want to learn more about VR technology. 
                        I think MTU North Camps is a fantastic place to study Computing and I look forward to applying for a place there.</br>
                        That was my Friday in a nutshell. I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post and stay tuned for more updates from me.
