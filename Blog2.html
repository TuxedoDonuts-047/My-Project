                    This morning, I walked to the bus station and took a bus to Tralee just like yesterday.</br>
                    On my way to the bus station, I decided to look up the news and found out that new Gundam model kits 
                    (Gunpla) were revealed during the<a href="https://bandai-hobby.net/site/nextphase2023spring/" target="_blank">Hobby Next Phase 2023 Spring</a></br>event.
                    One of these new Gunpla was the<a href="https://bandai-hobby.net/item/5798/" target="_blank">RG Epyon</a> 
                    This model kit peaked my interest because of its maroon color scheme and its ability to transform into a two-headed dragon. </br>

                    When I arrived in Tralee and into the College and went on with my day.</br>

                    That was my Tuesday in a nutshell. I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post and stay tuned for more updates from me.

                        <p> On Tuesday 21st of March 2023, I had an interesting day. I walked over to the bus station and went on it to go to Tralee. 
                        Once there, I clocked in and left to Manor West Retail Park, Tralee.
                        One of the places I visited was Currys, where I saw the Meta Quest 2 on display. 
                        This is a new all-in-one VR headset that offers impressive performance and features. 
                        Firstly, it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 CPU, 6 GB of RAM, and storage options of 128 GB or 256 GB.  
                        However, I also knew that the Meta Quest 3 will be released later this year, so I decided to wait for that.
                        After browsing Currys, I went to Costa Coffee and got a Salted Caramel Frappe and a cinnamon bun. 
                        I then returned to the College and finished my work for the day.</br>
                        
                        That was my Tuesday in a nutshell. I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post and stay tuned for more updates from me.
